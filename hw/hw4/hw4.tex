\section*{Overview:}
In this assignment, you'll be completing 1 problem using SPSS (or R). This problem covers topics from Chapter 7 in your textbook.

\subsection*{Problem 1 (\textit{Correlation $r$})}
\begin{itemize}
\item Using the GSS 2014 data set (\texttt{GSS2014\_final})\footnote{For SPSS, use \texttt{GSS2014\_final.sav}. For R, use the R script and \texttt{GSS2014\_final.csv}}, report the means and standard deviations of ``political (conservative) views'' (\texttt{polviews}) and people's belief that the it is an important right for citizens to engage in civil disobedience when they oppose government actions (\texttt{oppsegov}\footnote{Higher scores indicate that people believe civil disobedience against the government is a very important right (e.g. must be protected)}).
\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{polviews} and \texttt{oppsegov} should be changed to scale measures
\end{itemize}
\item Display a scatterplot, and include a fit line, for ``political (conservative) views'' (\texttt{polviews}) and the importance of civil disobedience as a right (\texttt{oppsegov}).
\item What is the value of the $r$ coefficient? 
\item Correctly and fully report and interpret the $r$ coefficient (using the example from our lecture slides, including the $r$ value, the degrees of freedom, and the p-value).
\item Report the $r^{2}$ coefficient and interpret it.
\end{itemize}
